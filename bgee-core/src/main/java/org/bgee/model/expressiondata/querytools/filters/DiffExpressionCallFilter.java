     * <p>
     * This minimum number of conditions applies to conditions related 
     * to the <code>DiffExpressionFactor</code> returned by {@link #getFactor()}. 
     * For instance, if the value returned by {@link #getFactor()} is 
     * <code>ANATOMY</code>, this threshold is the minimum number of organs 
     * compared. Or if equal to <code>DEVELOPMENT</code>, it is the minimum number 
     * of developmental stages studied.
     * <p>
     * Note that the minimum number of conditions specified by the Bgee pipeline 
     * to proceed to a differential expression analysis is still applicable in any case.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Warning: </strong>because Bgee reconciles results obtained from different 
     * experiments, the calls retrieved can still include analyses with less conditions 
     * compared. What this parameter specifies, it is that a call should <em>involve</em> 
     * <em>some</em> analyses with that minimum number of conditions. 
     * For instance: if an analysis compared 3 organs A, B, and C, at a same 
     * developmental stage, and generated a call that a gene is under-expressed in A; 
     * and if another analysis, comparing 5 organs A, B, C, D, and E, at the same 
     * developmental stage, generated a call that the same gene is over-expressed 
     * in A; Then Bgee will generate an over-expression call with low confidence from 
     * these two experiments; using only the experiments with 5 conditions would 
     * generate a high confidence call. But this is not what you would retrieve 
     * by setting this parameter to 5; you would still retrieve the low confidence call, 
     * because data are not re-computed, just filtered.  
     * <p>
     * To actually recompute differential expression calls by filtering experiments 
     * based on the number of conditions compared, use a {@link RawDataFilter}
