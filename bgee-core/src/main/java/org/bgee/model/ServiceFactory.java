/**
 * Factory allowing to obtain {@link Service}s. 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Implementation specifications: </strong> It was chosen to not use 
 * an abstract factory pattern to obtain {@code Service}s, to avoid multiplication 
 * of interfaces and classes, and because such a need was not foreseen at middle term. 
 * When different implementations of a {@code Service} exist, it is the responsibility 
 * of this {@code ServiceFactory} to directly return the appropriate implementation. 
 * At present, different implementations of a {@code Service} are not extending 
 * a common interface, but extending an already-existing implementation. 
 * <p>
 * An example of {@code ServiceFactory} method capable of returning different {@code Service} 
 * implementations could be: 
 * <pre><code>
 * public static GeneService getGeneService() {
 *     if (BgeeProperties.getBgeeProperties().useStaticFactories()) {
 *         return new StaticGeneService(); //class extending GeneService
 *     }
 *     return new GeneService();
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * At middle term, the different implementations of {@code Service}s that are expected to be created are: 
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code Service}s directly using {@code DAO}s to retrieve data.
 * <li>{@code Service}s retrieving data from {@code DAO}s and storing them into a cache, 
 * during their static initialization, then using these cached data rather than {@code DAO}s.
 * <ul>
