def: "An assertion method that does not involve human review." [ECO:MCC]
comment: An automatic assertion is based on computationally generated information that is not reviewed by a person prior to making the assertion. For example, one common type of automatic assertion involves creating an association of evidence with an entity based on commonness of attributes of that entity and another entity for which an assertion already exists. The commonness is determined algorithmically.

comment: A manual assertion could be based on evidence that is generated by and interpreted by a human or it could involve human review of computationally generated information.
