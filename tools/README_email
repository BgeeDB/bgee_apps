E-mail address obfuscation is useful to protect e-mail against spam.

E-mail address obfuscation comes from this web site:
http://www.pgregg.com/projects/encode/htmlemail.php
http://www.pgregg.com/projects/encode/htmlemail2.php


With the author, we have improve this (the delayed method and allow to add
several obfuscated e-mail addresses per page).



Basically, the method will swap characters, then encode them.
As a result, the e-mail address is visible only when the mouse is over the
link, or when we click on it.

The main problem is that, for a maximal obfuscation, you must not write the
real e-mail address between <a> tags, but another sentence or use an image
by example.
=> This does not allow you to copy e-mail address from screen.
=> And you need to enable javascript in your browser !



For static pages, and when e-mail addresses don't change often, the
"obfuscate_email.pl" perl script can generate the code to paste in the HTML.

For dynamic pages, the PHP code is available from the links above.
I have transposed this code in:
- Perl (EMailObfuscation.pm module or obfuscate_email.pl script)
- Java (EMailObfuscation.java)



Obfuscation used in the index.html page was generated with this command line:
(<a class=\"sib_mail\" href=\"#\" ...
was used line 23, to apply SIB CSS, instead of
<a href=\"#\")
./obfuscate_email.pl Firstname.Lastname@mail.example.org "Firstname.Lastname [AT] mail.example.org" 0

./obfuscate_email.pl e-mail_addresses [[text_to_print] [index_number]]
    e-mail_addresses:   One or several e-mail addresses comma separated.
    text_to_print:      Text which will be displayed on screen.
                        It can be a simple text or
                        an image (<img src='...' alt='...'>)
    index_number        Use different index number when there are several
                        obfuscations in the same page.
