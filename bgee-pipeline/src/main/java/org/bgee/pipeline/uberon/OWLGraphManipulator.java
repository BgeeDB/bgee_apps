/**
 * This class provides functionalities to modify an ontology to simplify its graph structure. 
 * The resulting ontology will not be suitable for reasoning. The aim of this class 
 * is only to make an ontology suitable for a nicer graph display. 
 * <p>
 * Notably, at instantiation of this class, several operations are performed to obtain only 
 * simple edges between classes, similar to what the method {@link 
 * OWLGraphWrapperEdges#getOutgoingEdges(OWLObject) getOutgoingEdges} is simulating. 
 * The operations performed are, in order: 
 * <ol>
 *   <li>to reverse all {@code OWLObjectUnionOf}s, that are part of 
 *   an {@code OWLEquivalentClassesAxiom}, into individual {@code OWLSubClassOfAxiom}s, where 
 *   the named classes part of the {@code OWLObjectUnionOf} become subclasses, and 
 *   the top level named classes of the {@code OWLEquivalentClassesAxiom}, superclass. 
 *   <li>to relax all {@code OWLEquivalentClassesAxiom}s into {@code OWLSubClassOfAxiom}s 
 *   using a <a href=
 *   'http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/semanticweb/owlapi/ConvertEquivalentClassesToSuperClasses.html'>
 *    ConvertEquivalentClassesToSuperClasses</a>.
 *   <li>to relax all {@code OWLSubClassOfAxiom}s, whose superclass is an 
 *   {@code OWLObjectIntersectionOf}, into multiple {@code OWLSubClassOfAxiom}s, using a <a 
 *   href='http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/semanticweb/owlapi/SplitSubClassAxioms.html'>
 *   SplitSubClassAxioms</a>.
 *   <li>to remove any {@code OWLEquivalentClassesAxiom} or {@code OWLSubClassOfAxiom} using 
 *   an {@code OWLObjectUnionOf}.
 * </ol>
 * These operations will then allow to remove specific edges between terms, 
 * without impacting other edges that would be associated to them, through 
 * {@code OWLEquivalentClassesAxiom}s, or {@code OWLObjectIntersectionOf}s, or 
 * {@code OWLObjectUnionOf}s. These operations are doing for real what the method {@link 
 * OWLGraphWrapperEdges#getOutgoingEdges(OWLObject) getOutgoingEdges} is simulating 
 * under the hood.
 * <p>
 * Even before these operations take place, all imported ontologies are merged into 
 * the source ontology, then removed from the import closure, to be able 
 * to modify any relation or any class. 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning: </strong>these operations must be performed on an ontology 
 * already reasoned, as this class does not accept any reasoner for now. 
 * <p>
 * This class then allows to perform:
 * <ul>
 * <li><u>relation reduction</u> using regular composition rules, and composition over 
 * super properties, see {@link #reduceRelations()}. 
 * <li><u>relation reduction semantically incorrect</u> over relations is_a (SubClassOf) 
 * and part_of (or sub-relations), see {@link #reducePartOfIsARelations()}. 
 * <li><u>class removal and relation propagation</u>, using regular composition rules, 
 * and composition over super properties, see {@link #removeClassAndPropagateEdges(String)}.
 * <li><u>relation mapping to parent relations</u>, see {@link #mapRelationsToParent(Collection)} 
 * and {@link #mapRelationsToParent(Collection, Collection)}
 * <li><u>relation filtering or removal</u>, see {@link #filterRelations(Collection, boolean)} 
 * and {@link #removeRelations(Collection, boolean)}. 
 * <li><u>relation removal to subsets</u> if non orphan, see 
 * {@link #removeRelsToSubsets(Collection)} 
 * <li><u>subgraph filtering or removal</u>, see {@link #filterSubgraphs(Collection)} and 
 * {@link #removeSubgraphs(Collection, boolean)}. 
 * <li>a combination of these methods to <u>generate a simple ontology</u>, see 
 * {@link #simplifies(Collection, Collection, Collection, Collection, Collection) simplifies}.
